Chat GPT but using Voice ðŸ˜‰

Voice GPT based on Chat GPT but which speaks & listens!

Made using python and some cool libraries.

You can download and make a virtualenv(venv) and `pip install -r requirements.txt` and voila you can run it `python main.py`, just as simple as that. Oh you should get an api key for openai from here -> https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys.
